## **About me**
### **_My way_**
Hi, I am 27 years old and unemployed. 

About 3-4 years ago I first learned about web development, then just immersing myself in layout, having a solid theory of HTML & CSS and a little understanding of JS in 3 months, I felt at ease. If I took on a new layout or a new JS task I was so involved in the process that sometimes it was as if I had turned off reality and didn't notice anything around until I reached the desired result, working through everything down to the smallest detail.

My acquaintance with IT came from my younger brother, who at that time, at the age of 17, all by himself rented an office and created a website development team, consisting of two more or less layout designers, web designer, backend developer, and my brother, who was a full-stack developer, team leader and project manager in one. That's when my journey began, my desire then and now is to be part of this ship and create some product that is useful to people and in line with the latest technology at the time of its release, something particularly unique and exciting.

It's been 3-4 years since then, I've had to work somewhere, and depending on my previous non-IT job, I had my own set of responsibilities and routines that went against my self-development towards web development. Also, something bad happened to that dream team, leading to its dissolution and then my lack of understanding of what I should do next. Now that I have reached a turning point, I have decided to get back on my path and never turn away from it again.

### **_My aspirations_**
My path is one of perfection and self-development in information technology and web development in particular.

My desire is to team up with my brother, friends, and get this team back together, possibly with new faces, to create a project.

My goal...
>*"A samurai has no goal, only a path..."*

In the meantime, I need to become an independent unit and get my first earnings and real work experience in freelancing or in some company in the direction of front-end development.
